perform QUnit integration testing on the application. 
This testing will be very close to end-to-end testing, but not exactly the same, because the tests will check requests and responses using the JS fetch API, 
but not the UI functionality. We can also consider these as black box tests since the test design will not focus on the implementation of the SPA app or the frameworks it uses (such as lit-html and page.js).
